# Color Blocks 2

Now with 1,000,000% more Angular!

We converted a previous assignment of color blocks that previously used jQuery into integrating Angular with a focus of utilizing factories.
I migrated the logic which was previous hosted on controllers and localized it to the global factory.

Run `npm install` to start!
